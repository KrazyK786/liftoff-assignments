## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is a simple 'breakout' clone that adds on user authentication and a dashboard from which users can create
 a profile, view their game scores, and launch the game.  Future features will include creating friends, commenting
  on scores, and more available games.
  
  The simplicity of the application will provide opportunities to engage young and old alike, demonstrating some of
   the capabilities of programming, while
   promoting
   interest in
   technology as a whole
### Features

User dashboard: Users will be able to access a dashboard with their profile, game scores, and the ability to launch
 games
